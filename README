A bulgarian word generator written (haphazardly) in C++.

How it works: Given a 4x4 board of bulgarian letters it will generate all possible valid words genrated by connecting adjacent letter blocks. Uses a premade dictionary file containing the valid words. 

Once you start the executable it will take a few seconds to load up and (currently without any prompt) you will have to enter 16 letters seperated by space or newline characters representing the desired 4x4 arrangement you desire.

How to build: Use `make` and `make clean`.
